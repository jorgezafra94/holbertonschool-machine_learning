# TASKS
Here we are going to learn all the bases of Lineal Algebra so in order to fulfill that we are going to develop these tasks:

### 0-filter an array
In these task we have to slice an array using [::] method
```
arr = [9, 8, 2, 3, 9, 4, 1, 0, 3]
arr1 =  # your code here
arr2 =  # your code here
arr3 =  # your code here
print("The first two numbers of the array are: {}".format(arr1))
print("The last five numbers of the array are: {}".format(arr2))
print("The 2nd through 6th numbers of the array are: {}".format(arr3))
```
the idea is to get this output as result:
```
The first two numbers of the array are: [9, 8]
The last five numbers of the array are: [9, 4, 1, 0, 3]
The 2nd through 6th numbers of the array are: [8, 2, 3, 9, 4]
```
### 1-middle of matrix
Here we have to get the middle of each row of the matrix, so we need to use the [:, :]
where we are going to filter in axis 1
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
matrix = [[1, 3, 9, 4, 5, 8], [2, 4, 7, 3, 4, 0], [0, 3, 4, 6, 1, 5]]
the_middle = []
# your code here
print("The middle columns of the matrix are: {}".format(the_middle))
```
the output should be
```
The middle columns of the matrix are: [[9, 4], [7, 3], [4, 6]]
```

### 2-Size of matrix
In this task we have to return a list with the dimensions of a matrix
for example:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

matrix_shape = __import__('2-size_me_please').matrix_shape

mat1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
print(matrix_shape(mat1))
mat2 = [[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]],
        [[16, 17, 18, 19, 20], [21, 22, 23, 24, 25], [26, 27, 28, 29, 30]]]
print(matrix_shape(mat2))
```
the output should be like
```
[2, 2]
[2, 3, 5]
```
### 3-get the transpose of a matrix
In this task we have to return matrix that is the result of the transpose of a matrix
the transpose is change columns with rows
for example:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

matrix_transpose = __import__('3-flip_me_over').matrix_transpose

mat1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
print(mat1)
print(matrix_transpose(mat1))
mat2 = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
        [16, 17, 18, 19, 20], [21, 22, 23, 24, 25], [26, 27, 28, 29, 30]]
print(mat2)
print(matrix_transpose(mat2))
```
the output should be like
```
[[1, 2], [3, 4]]
[[1, 3], [2, 4]]
[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18, 19, 20], [21, 22, 23, 24, 25], [26, 27, 28, 29, 30]]

```
### 4-add two arrays

for example:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

add_arrays = __import__('4-line_up').add_arrays

arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
arr2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]
print(add_arrays(arr1, arr2))
print(arr1)
print(arr2)
print(add_arrays(arr1, [1, 2, 3]))
```
the output should be like

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[6, 7, 8]
```
### 7-concatenate two matrices 2D

mat2 = [[5, 6]]
mat3 = [[7], [8]]
mat4 = cat_matrices2D(mat1, mat2)
mat5 = cat_matrices2D(mat1, mat3, axis=1)
print(mat4)
print(mat5)
mat1[0] = [9, 10]
mat1[1].append(5)
print(mat1)
print(mat4)
print(mat5)
```
the output should be like
```
[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
