# Supervised Learning
Here are most important Methods of Supervised Training in Machine Learning Nowadays
## Binary Classification
This algorithm is able to Say if a picture is or not a specific class, I mean for example if a picture is a dog or it isnt.
Here we are going to learn concepts as:
* Perceptron
* Sigmoid Activation Function
* Lost Function (logarithmic logistic)
* Cost
* Neural Network
* Deep Neural Network
## Multiclass Classification
here we are going to use sigmoid and tanh activation functions <br>
also we are going to learn:
* One-Hot-Encode
* pickle Module in Python in order to store objects
* Multiple classification using DNN
## Tensorflow
here we are going to reply de Multiclass Classifier using tensorflow<br>
## Optimization
here we are going to use optimizations for training like:
* mini_batch training
* learning_rate_decay (alpha hyperparameter)
* Adam, gradient descent with momentum and RMSprop
* batch_normalization
